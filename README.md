# CheckPath

Simple Go utility that checks that entries in the environment
path variable has a directory associated with them. Used to
cleanup the environment (typically needed on Windows where
installation/uninstallation is a complete mess...).

Usage:

``` bash
go run cmd/checkpath.go
```

Check the output, if it lists any entries, remove them from path.

it looked nice :)
